# Conclave Gradle Plugin

The Conclave Gradle plugin allows users to configure and build their Conclave projects. It applies some
common plugins and dependencies, defines the Gradle tasks for building Native Image enclaves, and
enables the `conclave` block that is used in the enclave `build.gradle`.
