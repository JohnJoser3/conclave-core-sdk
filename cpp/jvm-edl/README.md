This module includes [Intel SGX EDL (Enclave Definition Language)](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/input-types-and-boundary-checking-edl-737361.pdf)
code which defines the ECALL and OCALL functions as well as how data is to be moved into and out of enclaves.

The files here define the interface between enclave and host.
