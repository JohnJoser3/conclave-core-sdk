# cpp/jvm-enclave-common
This is C/C++ code used in the enclave; it contains implementation or stubbing of Linux POSIX system calls that
get executed by the native binary code that has been generated after using `native-image` against the
enclave's Java/Kotlin code.

The artifact generated by this code is a C/C++ static archive library that gets linked when the user builds an enclave,
together with other static libraries, to form a standalone enclave.
