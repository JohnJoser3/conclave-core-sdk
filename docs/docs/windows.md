# Building under Windows


You can build enclaves for Linux directly on Windows without a virtualised Linux install. The resulting host JVM can be debugged remotely using JDWP as normal, although the enclave itself is a 'black box'. Windows developers can use the mock testing API for local debugging of the enclave Java too.
