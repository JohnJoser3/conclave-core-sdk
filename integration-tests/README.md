# Integration Tests

This is a separate gradle project which uses the published Conclave SDK to run integration-level tests. The artifacts
can be generated by running

```shell script
./gradlew sdkRepo
```

at the root level.

## Running the tests

Run the tests via [integration-tests.sh](../integration-tests.sh).

If running tests without the script (e.g to run individual tests), ensure that the SDK zip has been unpacked into
`build/distributions/`.

In CI, the tests are run using [ci_integration_tests.sh](../scripts/ci_integration_tests.sh).
